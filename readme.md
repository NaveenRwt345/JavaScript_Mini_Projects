Create a rectangle that behaves as follows:

*   When the mouse is at the center of the screen, the rectangle stays at the center.

*   When the mouse moves to the left, the rectangle also starts moving left, but its speed decreases as the mouse moves further left.

*   Similarly, when the mouse moves to the right, the rectangle starts moving right, and its speed decreases as the mouse moves further right.
